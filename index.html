          You believe football is part of life, not merely a “sport.” You throw
          the best tailgate party within a 50-mile radius. Championship Sunday
          is the most important day of the year. Unfortunately, you happen to
          lack the otherworldly size, physique and speed of today’s football
          players, putting the odds of you actually playing for your favorite
          team, well, nonexistent. Don’t despair! There are a number of jobs
          that could get you to close to the action—really close. Using data
          from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and PayScale.com, Monster rounded
          up 10 career paths that could someday get you in the game and make you
          part of a winning team.

          Football keeps you active, but it’s not the only exercise you should
          be doing. When playing football, you need to stay active for 45
          minutes at a time, and that takes some strength. Not to mention, you
          need good leg strength when kicking the ball, whether passing or
          taking a shot at a goal. Get down the gym, or create a home gym, and
          keep on top of your squats and lunges. Cycling is also fantastic
          exercise, so consider travelling by bike when you can.

            Budweiser has this week crowned Lionel Messi the undisputed King of
            Football after he scored a record-breaking 644th goal for Barcelona.
            A record previously held by Brazilian legend Pele for 46 years,
            Lionel Messi has scored the most goals for a single club in the
            history of professional football - a historic feat that many experts
            believe will stand for generations. To mark the moment, Budweiser
            has released a short film, created by Deutsch New York, titled
            ‘Kings aren’t made overnight’, featuring the limited-edition Lionel
            Messi bottle custom designed to celebrate his journey to greatness.
